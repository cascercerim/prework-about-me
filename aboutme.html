      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a wife and mom of two. I have the most supportive husband in the world who always tells me to 'go for it'. I always see him pushing himself outside of his comfort zone and he always accomplishes whatever he sets his mind too. He sells commercial insurance and does really well. I am lucky to be able to work part time during this time period. I work as a nursing assistant 2 nights a week. I work on a medsurge/ Icu step-down unit. It's fast paced, alot of work. I love the people but I'm ready for a change. Why I don't want to do nursing anymore? It's a great profession, I have such respect for anyone who works in the medical field. But I think sometimes it's just really brutal. Atleast with the floor I work on, it just seems like to me that some nurses don't get paid enough for everything they have to do on a daily basis. I did take all my pre-reqs for nursing school. I stopped and had my son. By the time I thought about going back, alot of my sciences were expiring. So I thought maybe I could find something that was quicker with better pay. My husband always said if he could go back it would be for computers. I researched high and low. Found the website Skillcrush. Started taking a course and fell inlove with it. I quickly realized though that I would benefit better in a classroom setting with like-minded people going through the same thing. </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I look at this as a craft. I like buiding things and creating things. Putting my own spin on it. When I first made a one page website I just loved how it looked and changing things up. It's amazing everything that goes in it all. It's alot of learning and the days are long and hard. But as long as you code everyday you will benefit. ABC's, Always be coding! I really like the front end aspect of coding. So possibly being a front-end developer. </p>
